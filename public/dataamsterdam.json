   "neighborhood_overview": "Indische Buurt (\"Indies Neighborhood\") is a neighbourhood in the eastern portion of the city of Amsterdam, in the Dutch province of Noord-Holland. The name dates from the early 20th century and is derived from the fact that the neighbourhood's streets are named after islands and other geographical concepts in the former Dutch colony of the Dutch East Indies. The first street was named in 1902. In 2003, there were around 23,357 inhabitants. The neighbourhood is bounded on the west by the railroad Amsterdam - Hilversum (with the Muiderpoort Station), on the east side by Flevopark, on the north side by Zeeburgerdijk and on the south side by the Ringvaart Watergraafsmeer. Indische Buurt is the oldest part of the Zeeburg district and is very ethnically diverse, and a high percentage of the population is of immigrant origin (for Zeeburg this is already high at 55%, but higher in the Indische Buurt) and there are an estimated 100 languages spoken.",

These days MP is a professional pianist and Joanna is distributor of Micro scooters for the Netherlands and has a store across the street from the house. In 2006 we bought our house from an old lady who had lived in it for 38 years. We have completely renovated it and now live here very happily with our two daughters. We love to travel, we love music and we love good food. We also really love Amsterdam! We can tip you off about local hangouts that you have to live here to know about and all the highlights that you really ought to see whilst you're here. This is the best area of the city to live in, that's why we picked it. Everything we need is right on our doorstep, we hardly ever have to leave our 'hood. You'll love it here too!",
