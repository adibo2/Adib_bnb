      "neighborhood_overview": "Indische Buurt (\"Indies Neighborhood\") is a neighbourhood in the eastern portion of the city of Amsterdam, in the Dutch province of Noord-Holland. The name dates from the early 20th century and is derived from the fact that the neighbourhood's streets are named after islands and other geographical concepts in the former Dutch colony of the Dutch East Indies. The first street was named in 1902. In 2003, there were around 23,357 inhabitants. The neighbourhood is bounded on the west by the railroad Amsterdam - Hilversum (with the Muiderpoort Station), on the east side by Flevopark, on the north side by Zeeburgerdijk and on the south side by the Ringvaart Watergraafsmeer. Indische Buurt is the oldest part of the Zeeburg district and is very ethnically diverse, and a high percentage of the population is of immigrant origin (for Zeeburg this is already high at 55%, but higher in the Indische Buurt) and there are an estimated 100 languages spoken.",

We love to travel, we love music and we love good food. We also really love Amsterdam! We can tip you off about local hangouts that you have to live here to know about and all the highlights that you really ought to see whilst you're here. This is the best area of the city to live in, that's why we picked it. Everything we need is right on our doorstep, we hardly ever have to leave our 'hood. You'll love it here too!",

It has a children's play area, a lovely little café that you can dash to for bacon sarnies in the morning and great views across Bristol.  <br /><br />There is a city farm a few minutes walk away as well and a meander into the centre of Bristol takes you through the park and you can choose to go easily along the harbourside to see the best of beautiful Bristol.",

I'm calm and friendly, respectful, easy to get along with person. When I travel, I like to stay in places that offer me privacy and space but helpful and friendly if I need anything. I like a clean, clear space, that I can call my own, so I aim to offer the same to my guests, I'm also open to a friendly chat and cuppa if you need that. I'm told people feel relaxed and at ease in my company. I am well traveled including time spent in West Africa and Europe. I've lived in Central and South America and the Caribbean. I love the arts and culture, I'm a practicing writer, photographer and therapist. I love music and dancing and for many years I worked alongside world music artists, working and traveling with artists from all over the world; I think this has given me a broad understanding, appreciation and acceptance of different people and different customs. I relate well to others and am told by people who have limited grasp of the english language that my spoken english and diction is clear and easy to understand. I speak a little spanglish! I like walking, nature and yoga. ",

It is a complex urban area with strong well defined character areas, illustrating a layering of different ages of development and use from 19th century terraced residential properties through larger business and commercial buildings, through elegant squares and open spaces to the post war public sector environment of St Paul’s itself.  Topographically the area is largely flat close to the centre but the northern areas of Montpelier have more interest in topographical terms.",

Want to hear the new young musicians that people are excited about or the promising new artists - we'll tell you about them. The best restaurants - ask us.\nWant to take a break from the city we'll tell you about wilderness canoeing on the Delaware river - just an hour and a half's drive. We can tell you where to find the great salt water fishing with clean beautiful waters just an hour away from the city or how to take a one day trip by bus to ski in Vermont.\n\n\nWHY WILLIAMSBURG?\n\nWilliamsburg is FABULOUS. It's fast growing and it's fast changing. It's hip. In the 1960's the new and exciting place where culture was blooming was Greenwich Village. In the 70's the SOHO neighborhood was where cheap industrial loft space were being turned into places where the adventurous could move to New York, live cheaply and make the new art, music, and culture. These days Williamsburg has that special chemistry of the New York that's constantly renewing itself. ",

I'm also a seasoned traveller and like to think I have a good feel for what guests are looking for in a travel accommodation experience.\nYour independent en-suite bedroom is like a small apartment and occupies a whole single floor of my house. It has its own lockable door and is directly accessible from the staircase. You also get the front door key. So you are completely independent. I live in one of the apartments, so if you want privacy and security here you have it or if you fancy a beer i can show you some local bars, restaurants and tourist sites.\nIn short you get a high quality en-suite double bedroom apartment, a bit like a hotel suite [linen, towels and toiletries are included and the bedroom is cleaned and prepared by a professional cleaner]. All at exceptionally competitive rates.\n",

Thank you for visiting my place! \n\nMy dream would be to work one day in the hospitality industry and I thank Airbnb for giving me an opportunity to start with my own place. \n\nI was born in France from Spanish mother and Italian father and I love travelling. This is one of the reasons why I am often out of town. I have studied finance in France and in Spain and have worked in the finance industry until last September. \n\nI love travelling in South America, especially in Uruguay. Most of my family lives there. The beaches are incredible, and the food is out of the world.  \n\nI cannot live without eating that is the least to say and I cook a lot but London has the best places to eat... ask me if you need advise!  we are lucky in London for that  ... And I cannot live without going to pineapple dance studio in London, they have some great classes too - you can learn anything  ... Bollywood dances and Flamenco for instance. \n\nI got this place last year, and I am sad I cannot live in it as much as I want to- this is why I want others to get the chance! \n\nBest,\n\nTania\n",
