I have lived in the area for over seven years now and I can honestly say it's one of the best places that I've lived in the Capital [and there's been quite a few!]. I'm also a seasoned traveller and like to think I have a good feel for what guests are looking for in a travel accommodation experience.\nYour independent en-suite bedroom is like a small apartment and occupies a whole single floor of my house. It has its own lockable door and is directly accessible from the staircase. You also get the front door key. So you are completely independent. I live in one of the apartments, so if you want privacy and security here you have it or if you fancy a beer i can show you some local bars, restaurants and tourist sites.\nIn short you get a high quality en-suite double bedroom apartment, a bit like a hotel suite [linen, towels and toiletries are included and the bedroom is cleaned and prepared by a professional cleaner]. All at exceptionally competitive rates.\n",

Thank you for visiting my place! \n\nMy dream would be to work one day in the hospitality industry and I thank Airbnb for giving me an opportunity to start with my own place. \n\nI was born in France from Spanish mother and Italian father and I love travelling. This is one of the reasons why I am often out of town. I have studied finance in France and in Spain and have worked in the finance industry until last September. \n\nI love travelling in South America, especially in Uruguay. Most of my family lives there. The beaches are incredible, and the food is out of the world.  \n\nI cannot live without eating that is the least to say and I cook a lot but London has the best places to eat... ask me if you need advise!  we are lucky in London for that  ... And I cannot live without going to pineapple dance studio in London, they have some great classes too - you can learn anything  ... Bollywood dances and Flamenco for instance. \n\nI got this place last year, and I am sad I cannot live in it as much as I want to- this is why I want others to get the chance! \n\nBest,\n\nTania\n",
