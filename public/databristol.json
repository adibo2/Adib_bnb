This looks fantastic at night with all the lights. <br /><br />The bathroom has a bath only (there is a shower attachment but it is not very powerful), but there is lots of hot water and bubble bath. There is a table and chair in the room as well as hanging space. <br /><br />The house is very homely; it's more very relaxed and shabby chic than perfection. There a quite a few walk books for the area that you are welcome to borrow. <br /><br />I live in the house and may well be there when you stay. I am away a lot of weekends, but generally there in the weeks.<br /><br /><b>Guest access</b><br />Guest's have access to the kitchen and the bathroom is also shared with",
          "neighborhood_overview": "The neighbourhood is friendly and welcoming; most houses are Victorian like mine, but the ones opposite are old miners cottages from the 1860's. <br /><br />Much of community life centres around Victoria Park which is a large lovely green space at the end of my road. It has a children's play area, a lovely little café that you can dash to for bacon sarnies in the morning and great views across Bristol.  <br /><br />There is a city farm a few minutes walk away as well and a meander into the centre of Bristol takes you through the park and you can choose to go easily along the harbourside to see the best of beautiful Bristol.",

I'm calm and friendly, respectful, easy to get along with person. When I travel, I like to stay in places that offer me privacy and space but helpful and friendly if I need anything. I like a clean, clear space, that I can call my own, so I aim to offer the same to my guests, I'm also open to a friendly chat and cuppa if you need that. I'm told people feel relaxed and at ease in my company. I am well traveled including time spent in West Africa and Europe. I've lived in Central and South America and the Caribbean. I love the arts and culture, I'm a practicing writer, photographer and therapist. I love music and dancing and for many years I worked alongside world music artists, working and traveling with artists from all over the world; I think this has given me a broad understanding, appreciation and acceptance of different people and different customs. I relate well to others and am told by people who have limited grasp of the english language that my spoken english and diction is clear and easy to understand. I speak a little spanglish! I like walking, nature and yoga. ",

It is a complex urban area with strong well defined character areas, illustrating a layering of different ages of development and use from 19th century terraced residential properties through larger business and commercial buildings, through elegant squares and open spaces to the post war public sector environment of St Paul’s itself.  Topographically the area is largely flat close to the centre but the northern areas of Montpelier have more interest in topographical terms.",

Families whose children attend the 3 or 4 primary schools in the area.  Professional people running architects practises, artists, gardeners, plenty of musicians,and many women who run businesses.  It has always felt to me like a special place where things happen.  As there are loads of restaurants and café's, bars, woman and men's clothes shops, Bristol's amazing ZOO, the Camera Obscura on the Downs, the Avon Gorge (with protected and unique plants and birds) there are as you can see lots of place to go and see.  The major one I leave till last - The Suspension Bridge.  I can genuinely only enthuse about my neighbourhood.",

I am from New Zealand and have been living in the UK for over thirty years, living in London for 15 years before settling here in Bristol for twenty years now. \r\n\nIn 2013  I joined the Airbnb Community offering homestay accommodation to travellers & visitors, university students, those looking to relocate and or work in Bristol for short stay visits. \n\nMy previous experience of homestay hosting involved working closely with an established Bristol English Language School, 2010 -2013. I was valued by them for my contribution to homestay experiences offered to their foreign language students. \n\nWith the unprecedented events of the 2020 Covid 19 Pandemic, I closed my doors to hosting from March 2020 until  \nJune 2021. The three lockdown phases, in particular, though challenging at times, offered me & I hope others some extraordinary experiences, a time to pause, reflect, restore, regroup. So much to fathom during them & in the uncertain times we now continue to face. Gentle, gentle. \n\nIt was with some reticence I concede, that I opened my doors to hosting again in the last weeks of June 2021. I am rediscovering again the enriching experience of sharing my home, creating a welcoming, relaxed & comfortable experience for others, a space where connecting in good conversation is valued & respected as much as the need for privacy & discretion. \n\nI feel immense gratitude for the experiences I have shared & been privilege to with guests through Airbnb hosting & I look forward to the many more experiences to come my way. \nWith much warmth & appreciation, Joanne ",

          "neighborhood_overview": "This is a vibrant, evolving community with people from all cultures and influences. It's not a beautiful area by any means,  so if you want a quiet, leafy suburb, this isn't for you. If you're after an inner-city, conveniently located place, close to the town and to train, coach and motorway, then this fits the bill. We are only a 12 minute walk to the shopping centre (Broadmead and Cabot Circus) where there is a large cinema and many restaurants. Away from town there is a road called St Mark's Road which has many lovely eating places. <br />Try the Greenbank, Volunteer Tavern or Phoenix pubs which are all a short distance away.",

I love to read and to go to the opera and theatre when I have a chance. I enjoy socialising with friends and spending lots of time with my little dogs.\r\n\r\nI think Airbnb is such a great idea, not only to make or to save a little money but also to meet lots of interesting people from all over the world and to help them explore and discover the amazing city of Bristol.\r\nI'm happy to help you with advice on where to go and what to see, both in Bristol and throughout the country.\r\n",
