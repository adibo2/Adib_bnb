We love city life but we also love outdoor adventures. We like keep up with all that's new and exciting around New York and we're happy to tell you where to find it. Want to hear the new young musicians that people are excited about or the promising new artists - we'll tell you about them. The best restaurants - ask us.\nWant to take a break from the city we'll tell you about wilderness canoeing on the Delaware river - just an hour and a half's drive. We can tell you where to find the great salt water fishing with clean beautiful waters just an hour away from the city or how to take a one day trip by bus to ski in Vermont.\n\n\nWHY WILLIAMSBURG?\n\nWilliamsburg is FABULOUS. It's fast growing and it's fast changing. It's hip. In the 1960's the new and exciting place where culture was blooming was Greenwich Village. In the 70's the SOHO neighborhood was where cheap industrial loft space were being turned into places where the adventurous could move to New York, live cheaply and make the new art, music, and culture. These days Williamsburg has that special chemistry of the New York that's constantly renewing itself. ",
